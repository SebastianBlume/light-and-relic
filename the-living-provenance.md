# The Living Provenance: How I Continue the Origin of the Arknight Shard

## I. How Can Provenance Remain Alive?

On December 23, 2020, I pulled the **Arknight Shard (CRU000)** from a Crucible of War First Edition display bought from Kai of Cards at home.

Five years later, on **August 14, 2025**, I returned to **Corné van Dooren** in Ederveen to create a signed artifact (see: *The Return to Kai of Cards*).

Along the way, I understood something:  
**origin is not a state – it comes into being through action.**

Every act, every file, every journey, every signature is provenance.  
Together, they became the beginning of *Light and Relic* —  
a project where light, craft, and memory converge.

The story of that origin, and of the artist behind it, continues in *The Artists*.

My original intention was simple:  
I wanted to find the provenance of my Flesh and Blood card.

I thought provenance was a closed fact — something that exists, waiting to be discovered in an archive.

But the journey to Ederveen revealed something else.

By documenting every detail — GPS anchors, protocols, signatures —  
I realized I was **continuing** the story of the card, layer by layer.

**Provenance is not about finding, but about continuing a story.**

Authenticity becomes a process rather than a state.  
The relic becomes a growing document of artistic and documentary action.

This forms the foundation of the **Artefact & Provenance** section —  
where physical print, digital signatures, and timestamped data merge into a verifiable artistic document.

## II. When Does Precision Become Art?

If provenance is a process, I need a method to make this act verifiable.  
This is where philosophy meets craftsmanship.

My work in *Light and Relic* is a method of **artistic data transformation**.

I document the surface of the Arknight Shard using:

- raking light  
- nine-zone focus stacking  
- microstructure extraction  
- vector mapping (N≈114)  
- JSON archival storage  
- FES digital signatures  
- OpenTimestamps anchoring  

The full research abstract and archival documentation are registered at Zenodo:

**DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17458288**

Thus an image becomes a verifiable imprint —  
not as a number in a slab, but as an open, auditable memory.

This is the **aesthetics of accuracy**.

I do this to give curators and collectors proof they can hold in their hands.

## III. Why Does Every Truth Need Its Shadow?

The Arknight Shard became an anchor during my darkest times.

After my deployment in Afghanistan, I had to give up my career due to PTSD.  
In that time, I almost lost everything — except the card.

The meeting with **Andreas Rimkus** in his forge —  
where the Shard was photographed before the fire —  
was a symbolic act of forging and transformation.

I am not only a collector — **I am a creator**.

Truth without shadow is incomplete.

I show both — the aesthetics of light and the traces of wear.  
This duality is the essence of authenticity  
and the core of my artistic credibility.

Perhaps every collector reaches the moment when ownership becomes meaning.

## IV. How Does a Print Become a Traveling Companion?

The signed print **1/3** is not just an outcome — it is a companion.

It travels with me —  
just as the card once did.

Each new photograph, each location, each encounter expands its memory.  
Not digitally — but through lived presence.

I photograph it in places that carry cultural or emotional meaning.

Each place becomes part of the Shard’s story —  
a growing network of light, memory, and witness.

When I set up the print, light it, and capture it again,  
I write another line in its protocol — not as a number or code,  
but as a **trace**.

Thus, the work grows not only through data,  
but through **space, time, and human experience.**

## V. For Whom Do I Continue This Story?

Flesh and Blood was the beginning —  
the work of Legend Story Studios that gave me strength in difficult times.

From a card I could never sell,  
a compass emerged:  
a proof that **structure, symbolism, and light persist even in darkness.**

This project is a gesture of gratitude —  
a way to give back.

I do this not only for myself.

I want to show how an object you merely own  
can become an artifact of meaning —  
something that orders memories, touches wounds, transforms history.

Many people carry objects that are more than valuables:

- cards  
- photos  
- instruments  
- letters  

I want to show how to **read them anew** —  
how to bring them back into the light  
and turn them into personal relics.

For collectors, I want to make visible  
that uniqueness lies not only in condition  
but in **story**,  
and how it is preserved and shared.

What I do with the Arknight Shard, anyone can do:  
listen to an object until it speaks.

---

## VI. When Does Art Become Proof?

Provenance is not merely evidence —  
it is an **ethical act**,  
a declaration of being visible.

The living provenance grows with every light I direct toward the relic.

Every layer, every file, every journey  
is an act of preservation — and of becoming.

Truth arises through action.

In *Light and Relic*, I unite collecting, research, and creation  
into a practice of authenticity —  
something one cannot own,  
but must continually renew.

As long as I act, the provenance remains alive.
