# The Pull That Started It All  
### Arknight Shard & the Beginning of My Journey

## A December Evening, Two Displays

Just before Christmas 2020.  
Two sealed displays on the table, freshly delivered from Kai of Cards.  
They were my very first TCG displays – a step into unknown territory, a gift to myself.

A friend sat beside me as we prepared to open them.  
The sound of the wrapping tearing, the weight of anticipation –  
it all felt ritualistic.

## The Moment of the Pull

Pack by pack, we worked our way through –  
until it happened:

### **My very first Cold Foil. The Arknight Shard.**

My pulse raced.  
Disbelief, astonishment, excitement.  
I could hardly believe what I was holding.

At the same time, I didn’t yet realize the full weight of this card –  
or how it would later accompany me on a journey far beyond the game itself.

## Viserai Appears

Inside the package was more than just the displays.  
A promo card was included:

### **Viserari — Rainbow Foil.**

At first it seemed like a small bonus.  
Looking back, it marked the beginning of a dual story:

- **Arknight Shard**  
- **Viserai**

Two figures that have followed me ever since.  
Their presence became a thread that runs throughout my project.

## More Than a Lucky Draw

December 23, 2020 was more than just the day I pulled a rare card.  
It was the beginning of my fascination with Flesh and Blood –  
and the first step in a much larger process.

What felt like chance in that moment  
has since become the foundation of my work:

### the first link in the provenance of an artifact  
that I would gradually transform  
into a **contemporary relic**.

## A Spark That Caught Fire

Two displays, a friend, a card.  
Simple facts.

Yet from this moment, something much larger began –  
something that continues to grow through **Light and Relic**.

Back then, it was just a pull.  
Today, it stands as the **origin of a story still being told.**
