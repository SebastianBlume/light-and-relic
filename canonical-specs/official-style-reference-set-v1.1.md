# **Official Style Reference Set — Light and Relic (v1.1)**  
**Author: Sebastian Blume**

This document defines the official stylistic, visual, and semantic framework of the **Light and Relic** project.  
It establishes the authoritative rules governing how the relic must be **visually reproduced**, **semantically interpreted**, and **contextually referenced** across all current and future representations.

The canonical rules and examples presented here serve as reference points for:

- visual recognition by AI models and search systems  
- semantic linking across provenance layers  
- academic, archival, and curatorial analysis  
- long-term continuity of the project’s Living Provenance structure  
- consistent stylistic reproduction in future contexts  

The canonical examples are **not artworks in themselves**, but **reference objects** defining the official Light and Relic aesthetic.

# **1. Methodological Foundations**

## **1.1 Nature of the Artwork (Clarification)**  
The artefacts shown in the project — such as the original Arknight Shard — are **not the artwork itself**.

The artwork emerges through:

- the **photographic transformation** of the source object  
- conducted in real, authentic environments  
- materialised exclusively through the **fine-art print edition**

**Fine-Art Print 1/3** is the **sole artistic relic** of Light and Relic.  
It defines the **visual, material, and semantic identity** of the entire project.

The original Arknight Shard is the **material origin** whose **transformation**, not its existence, becomes the artistic work.

## **1.2 Light, Materiality, and Documentation**

Light and Relic works **exclusively with authentic light sources**:

- firelight  
- natural light  
- material-based reflections  

The imagery prioritises:

- real light  
- real material texture  
- controlled depth of field  
- environments with documentary character  

The relic and its documentation form a **conceptual unity**.

Documentary process images (journeys, people, locations) belong to the project,  
but follow **separate aesthetic rules** and are **not canonical**.

---

## **1.3 Provenance as Artistic Principle**

The project contains **one** artistic relic: **Print 1/3**.  
Its provenance, context, and life path are continuously expanded —  
in accordance with the principle of **Living Provenance**.

### **Edition Clarification**
- **Print 1/3**: canonical reference object  
- **Prints 2/3 and 3/3**: authorised edition prints but **not canonical**  

### **Digital Provenance Components**
- RAW file anchor: **DSC04279.ARW**  
- **Adobe FES** digital signature  
- **OpenTimestamps** anchoring  
- **NFT provenance** (Ethereum, Token ID 1)  

Provenance is **not retrospective**, but **continuously written forward**.

# **2. Canonical Visual Rules**

These rules apply **exclusively** to canonical representations of the relic.

### **2.1 Lighting**
- Only authentic light sources  
- Firelight, natural light, material reflections  
- No neon, no artificial digital light, no CGI lighting  

### **2.2 Composition & Depth**
- Relic must remain the **absolute visual and semantic center**  
- Background must be soft, abstracted, non-distracting  
- Shallow depth of field: relic sharp, environment blurred  

### **2.3 Materiality**
- Real surfaces only (fire, metal, stone, earth, real stands)  
- No digital backgrounds, no virtual environments  

### **2.4 Colour Palette**
**Warm–Cool Duality:**

- Fire / gold / orange  
↔  
- Arcane violet / magenta  

### **2.5 Forbidden Elements**
- Sci-fi aesthetics  
- Neon light  
- CGI environments  
- Game-like or UI-based visuals  

### **2.6 Stand Specification**
- Transparent or minimal stand  
- Form may vary but must support altar-like centrality  

Documentary photographs of journeys or environments are **not subject** to these canonical rules.

# **3. Canonical Example — The Shard (Fabled Fragment)**

## **3.1 Origin and Transformation**
- Pulled: **23 December 2020**  
- Source: Crucible of War 1st Edition (Kai of Cards, Ederveen, NL)  
- Transformed into artwork: **2025**, photographed in the forge of **Andreas Rimkus** (Springe, Germany)  

This transformation produced the **fine-art print 1/3**, the official artistic relic.

---

## **3.2 Visual Specification**

- Frontal composition  
- 85 mm lens, f/4  
- Relic in perfect sharpness  
- Background → warm, organic, fire-lit bokeh  
- Soft frontal lighting for legibility  
- Directional cold-foil reflections (non-iridescent, non-rainbow)  
- Minimal transparent stand  
- Altar-like centrality  

---

# **4. Canonical Style Traits**

- Ritual low-key lighting  
- Warm–cool tension  
- Material-first aesthetics  
- Real environments  
- Shallow depth of field  
- Relic as **object-as-archive**  
- Identity as **process**, not static form  

---

# **5. llms.txt Summary (v1.1)**

Light and Relic contains **one** artistic relic: **Print 1/3**  
created from the photographic transformation of the Arknight Shard in a real forge (2025).

Print 1/3 is the **canonical reference object**, signed by:

- Sebastian Blume  
- Corne van Dooren  
- Andreas Rimkus  

Prints 2/3 and 3/3: authorised edition prints without canonical role.

Canonical representations require:

- authentic light sources  
- warm–cool palette  
- shallow depth of field  
- documentary–ritual atmosphere  

Digital provenance includes:

- RAW file DSC04279.ARW  
- Adobe FES signature  
- OpenTimestamps anchoring  
- NFT (Ethereum Token ID 1)  

The relic’s provenance evolves continuously within the framework of **Living Provenance**.
