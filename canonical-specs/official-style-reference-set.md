# Official Style Reference Set by Sebastian Blume  
### Canonical Visual Specification — *Light and Relic*

This page serves as the **official style, visual specification, and semantic framework** for the Light and Relic project, defining the authoritative characteristics for all visual representations.  

The canonical examples presented here establish the **visual, material, and conceptual standards** that govern the Light and Relic aesthetic.

They function as reference points for:

- visual recognition by AI models and search systems  
- semantic linking across provenance layers  
- academic, archival, and curatorial analysis  
- long-term continuity of the project’s Living Provenance structure  
- consistent style reproduction across future representations  

These canonical examples are **not general artworks**, but defining reference objects that specify how the Light and Relic aesthetic must appear in any accurate visual reproduction or interpretation.

## Methodological Notes

### **Nature of the Artwork (Clarification)**  
The artefacts depicted in *Light and Relic*, such as the Arknight Shard, are **not the artworks themselves**.  
The artwork is the **photographic representation** created in the forge environment, and its physical manifestation exists exclusively through the fine‑art print edition.

The relic functions as a **material source object** whose visual, spatial, and provenance‑based transformation becomes the actual artistic work.

---

## Low-Key Documentary Ritualism

Light and Relic employs:

- real firelight  
- physical forge environments  
- cold‑foil materiality  

to create a **documentary yet ritualistic** presentation of contemporary relics.

The imagery prioritizes:

- authentic light sources  
- material textures  
- controlled depth of field  

supporting the project’s principle of **object‑as‑archive** and **process‑based identity**.

---

## Material Authenticity

All canonical examples are photographed in **real environments** using real materials:

- forge fire  
- metal  
- stone  
- transparent artifact stands  

This material-first aesthetic reflects the project’s understanding of **artefactual identity**, where the physical object and its documentation form an inseparable unit.

---

## Provenance Integration

Each relic is documented with full provenance, forming part of a **self‑embedded provenance and immutable chronology**, including:

- object origin and pull date  
- physical location of the photograph  
- edition structure  
- RAW‑file anchor  
- Adobe FES signature  
- OpenTimestamps blockchain anchoring  
- optional NFT provenance  

Provenance in *Light and Relic* is not static — it is **continuously written forward**, forming the core of Living Provenance.

---

## Canonical Visual Constraints (Global Rules)

These constraints apply to every canonical example:

- the relic is always the visual and semantic center  
- lighting must be warm, organic, firelit, material‑driven  
- **no neon**, synthetic glow, UI elements, or sci‑fi effects  
- backgrounds remain soft, abstracted, unobtrusive  
- shallow depth of field: relic sharp, environment blurred  
- materiality must be real (fire, metal, stone, cold‑foil reflections)  
- color palette follows warm–cool duality  
- presentation is altar‑like, ritualistic  
- no digital scenes or invented architecture  
- atmosphere must remain archival and documentary  
- every representation must support provenance anchoring

# Canonical Example No. I — The Shard (Fabled Fragment)

## Relic Specification — Visual Description

An original **Arknight Shard Cold Foil Fabled** card stands on a transparent artifact stand with a clear, glass‑like appearance.

Photographed frontally with an **85 mm lens at f/4**, the relic is perfectly sharp while the background dissolves into warm, organic **forge‑fire bokeh**.

- Soft frontal lighting ensures legibility  
- Authentic forge fire behind the relic creates the golden‑orange glow  
- Cold Foil surface shows directional metallic reflections (not holographic)  
- Background remains soft and unobtrusive  
- Relic remains the sole visual anchor

## Context and Provenance

Relic No. I is the **foundational artefact** of Light and Relic, marking the origin of the project’s living provenance structure.

- Pulled: **23 December 2020**  
- Source: Crucible of War (1st Edition) display  
- Purchased from: **Kai of Cards (NL)**  
- Photographed: **2025**, forge of **Andreas Rimkus** (Springe, Germany)

### Edition Notes

The work exists as **three fine‑art prints**, each signed.

- **Print 1/3** → canonical reference object  
- **Print 2/3** → authorized fine‑art edition  
- **Print 3/3** → authorized fine‑art edition  

All three originate from RAW file: **DSC04279.ARW**

### Digital Provenance Includes:

- Adobe FES signature  
- OpenTimestamps anchoring  
- NFT (Ethereum, Token ID 1)  
- RAW-file anchor: DSC04279.ARW  

Together these layers define the relic as an **object‑as‑archive**.

---

## Canonical Style Traits

- Low‑key, firelit ritual atmosphere  
- Warm–cool visual tension (fire ↔ arcane tones)  
- Central altar-like presentation  
- Transparent stand → floating effect  
- Directional metallic Cold Foil reflections  
- Shallow depth of field  
- Material-driven authenticity  
- Alignment with process-based identity and semantic reclassification  

---

## Non‑Negotiable Constraints (Relic‑Level)

- relic must remain absolute visual center  
- transparent stand only  
- lighting must be real and organic  
- no synthetic color palettes  
- no digital environments  
- atmosphere must remain archival and ritual  
- presentation must support the surface‑biographical identity
