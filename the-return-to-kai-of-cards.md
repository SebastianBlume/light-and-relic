# The Return to Kai of Cards  
### 700 Kilometers for the Arknight Shard Cold Foil

## 700 Kilometers for a Card – and Why It Was More Than a Drive

Sometimes a piece of cardboard takes you further than you could ever imagine.

For me, it meant **700 kilometers to Ederveen in the Netherlands** –  
to one of the first stores that brought Flesh and Blood TCG to Europe: **Kai of Cards**.

In 2020, I ordered two Crucible of War First Edition displays from there.  
Inside one of them was my very first Cold Foil – **the Arknight Shard (CRU000)**.

I have already described that moment in the blog post:  
**The Pull That Started It All** – the instant when everything began.

But for me, this card was never just a collectible.  
It became a symbol of holding on – in times when I almost lost everything else.

That tension between loss and creation later defined my path as an artist –  
a journey I describe in **The Artists**.

## Why the Arknight Shard Means More to Me Than a Card

In 2011, I served as a soldier in Afghanistan – and narrowly survived.  
Afterwards, I worked as an international photographer in New York until my career came to an abrupt end due to **post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**.

Years later, that same search for meaning and endurance became the foundation of my current work:  
the conceptual art project **Light and Relic**.

During this time, the trading card game Flesh and Blood became more than a hobby.  
It helped me cope with the challenges of my condition and regain stability.

There was a moment when PTSD had pulled me down so deeply that I nearly lost everything –  
money, safety, even a roof over my head.

At that point, I seriously considered selling the Arknight Shard Cold Foil.

But I didn’t.

It stayed with me — and today it reminds me that even in the darkest times,  
**some things are worth holding onto.**

That decision eventually became the foundation of my photographic study  
**The True DNA of the Arknight Shard**,  
where I explore how light itself can record truth.

## Reaching Out – and a Personal Hurdle

On **August 5, 2025**, I wrote to Kai of Cards – the place where the journey of this card began.

Since my deployment in Afghanistan, using English has been a particular hurdle for me,  
and writing this email meant stepping out of my comfort zone.

I put my thoughts into words:

> “The Shard symbolizes fragility, structure, energy – and transformation.  
> For me, Kai of Cards is a central part of this story, because it is where everything began.”

That same evening, I received a reply from **Corné van Dooren**, founder of Kai of Cards:

> “For the English part, don’t worry too much about it.”

The way was open for a meeting on **August 14, 2025**.

## Preparing for the Journey

The Shard did not travel in just a card sleeve.

For the trip, I modified a **B&W Type 3000 outdoor case** –  
robust, shockproof, padded like a shrine.  
Every stage of the drive was meant to show:

**This artifact was not being moved lightly.**

## On the Road to Ederveen

**From Hanover to Ederveen. 700 kilometers. Seven hours in a rental car.**

The card safely beside me.  
The hum of the highway.  
The glow of the navigation system in the dark.

At the border, the sign read **“Nederland”**, plastered with stickers –  
a quiet yet unmistakable marker.  
The moment when a long drive turned into a pilgrimage.

Finally, the town sign: **Ederveen**.

Just a small piece of metal by the roadside —  
yet the visible sign that the journey had reached its destination.

## Kai of Cards – A Pioneer Store for Flesh and Blood

Kai of Cards was the first store in the Netherlands to carry Flesh and Blood TCG in 2019 –  
imported directly from New Zealand.

Its founder, **Corné van Dooren**,  
was a co-founder of the **FAB Five**,  
a content group that defined the early community.

## Meeting Corné

Corné welcomed me warmly, showed me his store,  
and spoke about tournaments, events,  
and the growing TCG community in the Netherlands.

## The Signature in the Store

One of the highlights was the signing of the **very first Light and Relic print (Edition 1/3)**.

Corné sat at his desk – surrounded by shelves and screens –  
and signed the print.

## In Front of the Store – Origin and Return

To conclude, we captured the Shard once more,  
this time directly in front of the Kai of Cards logo.

The photo speaks without many words:

**Here the journey began.  
Here it returned.**

## From Trading Card to Contemporary Relic

This journey was more than a drive.

It was about honoring the origin,  
overcoming a personal hurdle,  
and acknowledging how a single pull in 2020  
became strong enough to carry an entire work.

For collectors, the Arknight Shard is a rare treasure.  
But for me, it is above all a testimony that:

**In the darkest moments, some things are worth not letting go.**
