Book"* from the Light and Relic project. It documents the publication
metadata, download link, and conceptual framing of the first book
released within the project's evolving provenance structure.

## Overview

**Light and Relic --- The Beginning**\
This book is the first publication within the Light and Relic project.\
It functions as a prologue, contextual archive of origin, and narrative
foundation --- but it is *not* a relic within the system of Living
Provenance.

The project's first relic is the **Fine-Art Print 1/3**.

## Description

The image featured on the cover shows the Fine-Art Print "Arknight
Shard" staged before fire --- the core artwork of the project.\
Its presence does not mark the creation of a new relic, but the
continuation of a **Living Provenance Relic**, whose layered
authenticity, memory structure, and contextual biography expand over
time.

Fire, material presence, and object-borne memory appear as symbolic
elements in the singular provenance evolution of Print 1/3.

## Conceptual Context

Within the Light and Relic system, this book contributes to:

-   contextual and material transition\
-   documentation as artistic act\
-   object-as-archive\
-   semantic reclassification\
-   living documentation\
-   archival continuity

It expands the narrative structure of the project without generating a
new relic, functioning instead as a **publication node** within the
broader provenance architecture.
