## Where Light, Fire, and Memory Meet

In a place where heat and will shape the impossible,  
these cards were not merely captured –  
**they were conjured.**

On this day, light, ash, and memory gathered in the forge of  
**Andreas Rimkus** – artist, blacksmith, guardian of ancient craft.

Here, where iron dances and fire whispers,  
the visual embodiment of artifacts  
from the world of *Flesh and Blood* took form.

These images were not made with light –  
**they were made with life.**

## The Teaching of the Fire

Andreas Rimkus taught me that fire is a being.  
That it must be fed.  
And that, if you are attentive, it will answer.

I photographed the cards –  
but **it was the fire that drew them.**
