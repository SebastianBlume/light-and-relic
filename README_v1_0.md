# Light and Relic — Archival and Provenance System (v1.0)
International Archival Edition

## 1. Purpose of the Repository
This repository functions as the digital provenance and archival layer of the Light and Relic project. It consolidates the canonical texts, data structures, specifications, and provenance layers that define the project’s Living Provenance System.

## 2. Object of the Project
The central artefact is not the physical card itself, but the system that transforms it: photographic representation, provenance layers, canonical surface-identity data structures, continuous documentation, and the Fine Art Print 1/3 as physical anchor.
