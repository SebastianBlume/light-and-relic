Sebastian Blume is a conceptual artist and photographer from Hanover, Germany.  
He is the initiator and sole creator of the *Light and Relic* project, which transforms the Flesh and Blood *Arknight Shard* into a contemporary relic through:

- controlled firelight photography  
- material authenticity  
- digital provenance  
- cryptographic documentation  
- long-term archival methods (Zenodo/DOI, OpenTimestamps, Adobe FES)

His practice merges personal trauma processing, ritualistic documentation, and conceptual image-making.  
The firelit photographic process in the forge of artist-blacksmith **Andreas Rimkus** forms the atmospheric backbone of the project.

- Exhibited at Deutsche Bank Hannover
