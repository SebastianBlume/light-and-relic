# **Inner Provenance Layer (IPL) — Definition & Archival Role (v1.1)**

## **1. Core Definition (ISO 704 / ISO 1087 compliant)**  
**The Inner Provenance Layer (IPL)** is a **sealed, non-public provenance stratum** containing a **single micro-inscription** embedded exclusively within the **Private Provenance File** of the relic.

The IPL is not visible, not extractable, and not part of any published image.  
It functions as the *inner, subjective witness* of the moment the relic came into being.

### **Terminology Development Notice**  
The conceptual definition of the IPL may evolve within the Living Provenance methodology **without altering** the archived IPL content or its fixity.

---

# **2. Function within the Living Provenance System**

The IPL exists inside the **digital provenance layer**, alongside:

- FES (Forensic Electronic Signature)  
- OTS (OpenTimestamps Bitcoin anchoring)  
- PAR2 redundancy  
- M-Disc archival preservation  

Unlike these, the IPL is a **content-bearing fragment** — a sealed anchor of meaning — not a procedural or forensic protocol.

It remains conceptually distinct from:

- **Surface Identity Method (SIM)** → objective micro-structures  
- **Material Provenance** → editions, prints, physical embodiments  
- **Visual Provenance** → photographic creation environment  

The IPL stores **qualitative, subjective meaning**, not measurable traces.

# **3. Purpose & Nature of the IPL**

The IPL is:

- **sealed**
- **non-public**
- **non-interactive**
- **cryptographically verifiable**
- **permanently fixed after creation**

Its purpose is a **sealed internal witness statement**, preserved inside the Private Provenance File.

The IPL’s significance emerges from its **concealment**, not from its content.

---

# **4. Why the IPL Remains Invisible**

- Its **integrity** is verifiable only through **file-hash equivalence**.  
- Its **content** remains forever sealed.  
- Its **existence** is anchored cryptographically.  

Isolation is essential:  
It protects the conceptual tension between **forensic disclosure** and **ritual sealing**, a core principle of Light and Relic.

### **Archival Fixity Clarification (ISO 23081)**  
Fixity applies **only** to the archived IPL content inside the Private Provenance File.  
Conceptual development of the IPL remains unrestricted.

---

# **5. Technical Verification Foundations**

Even though the IPL is hidden, its existence is cryptographically provable:

### **FES — Forensic Electronic Signature**  
Verifies authorship and file identity.

### **OTS — OpenTimestamps (Bitcoin)**  
Anchors the file on the blockchain; prevents backdating.

### **PAR2 — Parity Recovery**  
Protects against data degradation.

### **M-Disc Archival Storage**  
Ensures long-term physical preservation.

Together, these constitute a **sealed, immutable witness layer**.

# **6. Distinction from Other Provenance Layers**

**Not SIM**  
Does not record micro-structures or vector traces.

**Not Material Provenance**  
Not tied to prints or editions.

**Not Visual Provenance**  
Not related to photographic or environmental context.

**IPL = Inner conceptual anchor**, not a visual or measurable element.

---

# **7. Archival Role**

The IPL functions as:

- the **inner conceptual core** of the relic  
- a **sealed complement** to open provenance  
- an **unchanging archival witness**  
- a **qualitative layer** balancing the forensic precision of the system

> **Not every truth must be visible — but every truth must be verifiable.**
