# Inner Provenance Layer (IPL)  
### Definition, Function, and Archival Role within the Living Provenance System

The **Inner Provenance Layer (IPL)** is a sealed, non-public provenance stratum within the *Light and Relic* system.  
It contains a single, extremely small **micro-inscription**, visible only under extreme magnification and present exclusively inside the **Private Provenance File** of the relic.

The IPL is:

- **not an artwork**  
- **not a design element**  
- **not visible in any public image**  

It is the **inner, subjective witness layer** of the moment in which the relic came into being as a relic.

This page defines the IPL and documents its position and archival role within the **Living Provenance** methodology.

## 1. Nature and Purpose of the Inner Provenance Layer

The IPL is:

- sealed  
- non-public  
- not extractable  
- only verifiable via cryptographic integrity  
- preserved exclusively inside the Private Provenance File  

It contains an intimate artistic fragment from the genesis moment of the relic —  
a **subjective anchor** in conceptual tension with the forensic precision of the system.

Its purpose is not visibility, but:

### → a sealed internal witness statement embedded in the archival state of the file.

## 2. Position within the Living Provenance System

Within the Living Provenance model, the IPL belongs to the **process and methodological layer** and resides in the **digital provenance category**.

The IPL exists alongside:

- **FES** (Forensic Electronic Signature)  
- **OTS** (OpenTimestamps)  
- **PAR2** redundancy  

—but differs fundamentally:

- these verify **integrity**,  
- the IPL stores **meaning**.

It is distinct from:

- **Surface Identity Method (SIM)** — objective vector data  
- **Material Provenance** — physical print editions  
- **Visual Provenance** — photographic states  

The IPL carries **qualitative, subjective meaning** only.

## 3. Why the IPL Remains Invisible

The IPL is deliberately **never shown** publicly.  
Its significance arises from its **concealment**.

It acts through its **existence**, not through its content.

Verification occurs only through:

- file-hash equivalence  
- cryptographically sealed archival states  

The Living Provenance methodology requires a distinction between:

- **forensic disclosure**  
- **ritual sealing**

For this reason, the IPL exists solely inside the **Private Provenance File**, secured through:

- **FES**  
- **OTS**  
- **PAR2**  
- **M-Disc archival storage**

It becomes a **conceptual relic inside the digital relic**.

## 4. Technical Foundations of Verification

Even though its **content is hidden**, the IPL’s **existence** is fully verifiable:

### **FES — Forensic Electronic Signature**  
Verifies authorship and file identity.

### **OpenTimestamps (Bitcoin)**  
Anchors the file immutably and chronologically.

### **PAR2 Parity Recovery**  
Protects against data degradation.

### **M-Disc Permanent Storage**  
Ensures millennium-grade physical preservation.

Thus the IPL functions as a **sealed archival witness** whose state is cryptographically provable.

## 5. Distinction from Other Provenance Layers

The IPL must not be confused with:

### **Surface Identity Method (SIM)**  
→ objective macro/micro vector dataset

### **Material Provenance**  
→ editions, print artefacts, physical manifestations

### **Visual Provenance**  
→ photography, lighting, creation environment

**The IPL is none of these.**

It is an **internal, qualitative, sealed fragment**,  
not visual, not material, not measurable.

---

## 6. Archival Role

The IPL acts as:

- an inner layer of meaning  
- a conceptual core signature  
- a sealed complement to open provenance layers  

It fulfills the principle:

### **Not every truth must be visible — but every truth must be verifiable.**
